[Marco Arment](https://marco.org/2016/01/17/bitcoin-dysfunction):

> It’s interesting how often our allegedly “decentralized” technologies keep resulting in immense concentration of power among a few controlling parties. Once that happens, the worst sides of those few people usually control the entire system: dogmatic disagreements, power struggles, and greed.

E io, pensandoci, non è che abbia molto da aggiungere.
