**Rob Pike**, sulla mailing list ufficiale di Go:

> Mercurial has served us well, but it's time to move on. The world today is quite different from the world then. Most members of the Go community use Git and host their work on GitHub, and we should join them. Thanks to the efforts of open source projects like Android, we now have access to a Git-based code review system that fits our workflow. We are therefore pleased to announce that we plan to migrate the Go project and its subrepositories to GitHub. The issue tracker and the wiki will also be moved; all data will be preserved. We will use a Google-hosted instance of Gerrit for code reviews.

Ed ecco un altro progetto che non solo migra a **git**, che Ã¨ il mio VCS preferito, ma ospita il proprio codice su **GitHub** in maniera analoga a [quanto fatto da Microsoft con .NET Core](http://dottorblaster.it/2014/11/dot-net-core-open-source).
