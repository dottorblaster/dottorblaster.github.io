I grandi classici tra i **paradigmi dello sviluppo del software** continuano a confrontarsi, stavolta sul blog di **Greg Wilson**:

> Having spent a chunk of the holidays trying to explain and justify the baroque procedures needed to work with our workshop template, our lesson template, and this site, and why they're all different, I sympathize deeply with his yearning for clean design. Unfortunately, however, the cathedral model fails just as often and just as badly as the bazaar. As James Scott explains in Seeing Like a State, large organizations always favor uniformity over productivity, because without uniformity, the center cannot control the periphery. "One king, one law" can sometimes be a great force for good, but what you usually get is collectivized agriculture and UML.

Secondo me questo post non merita solo un'analisi, ma chiaramente persino anche una riflessione di carattere pi√π ampio su tutta la letteratura che linka.
