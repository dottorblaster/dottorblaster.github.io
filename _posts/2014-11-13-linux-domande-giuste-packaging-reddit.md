Tale **azalynx**, su Reddit, ha espresso un punto di vista riguardo **Linux** e ciÃ² che lo circonda col quale mi sono trovato a concordare molto negli ultimi tempi:

> The fact that you think Gentoo out of all possible distributions could've solved this issue kind of shows us that there is a major disconnect between members of our community, and _reality_. Compiling software from source is never going to be a viable solution for ordinary users, and it's a laughable proposition to suggest otherwise. The ironic thing is that our community actually got the closest to the solution, but we failed to make it user-friendly enough. Distribution repos are pretty good, but if you look at the way mobile app stores did it, they also containerized and sandboxed the apps, and they made the interface look and feel very clean; you've got your screenshots, reviews, and the install button. Our frontends were just never that easy, and of course we never had the sandboxing, or the ability for people to make money out of it (which is what created massive growth in mobile).

Credo che tutto il thread meriti uno sguardo, ci sono alcune cose interessanti, e dei link degni di nota. Buona lettura :-)
